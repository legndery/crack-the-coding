## Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

`unique.1.js`: Uses hashmap. O(N) complexity and O(N) space.  
`unique.2.js`: Uses sorting. O(NlogN) complexity and No extra space.  
`unique.3.js`: Uses bit vector. O(N) complexity and no Extra space.
